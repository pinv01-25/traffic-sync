Optimization Results Display
============================

This module handles the presentation of optimization results for the traffic signal
timing system based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). It provides a clean, readable
table comparing both the baseline and optimized values for each traffic cluster.

Key features include:

- Tabular display of green/red time recommendations per cluster.
- Integration of fuzzy congestion scores and categories.
- Side-by-side comparison of base formula vs. PSO-optimized results.
