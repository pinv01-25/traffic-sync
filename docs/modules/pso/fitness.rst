Fitness and Green Time Estimation
=================================

This module defines the functions used for evaluating traffic congestion in the
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) process. It includes:

- Academic green time estimation based on weighted traffic parameters.
- PSO-compatible fitness function using a fuzzy inference system.
- Parameter definitions for PSO timing constraints.

These components are used to guide the PSO algorithm in selecting optimal
signal timings that minimize traffic congestion.
