Hierarchical Clustering Module
==============================

This module performs hierarchical clustering on traffic sensor data using the crisp outputs 
from a fuzzy logic system. The goal is to group sensors by similarity in predicted congestion patterns,
using Ward's method and Euclidean distance. It also includes dendrogram visualization 
and cluster-level statistical analysis.
