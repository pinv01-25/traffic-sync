Hierarchical Clustering Evaluation Engine
===========================================

This module performs hierarchical clustering on the crisp outputs produced by
the fuzzy inference system to classify traffic sensor patterns. It computes
statistical summaries per cluster, provides detailed sensor assignments, and
renders an interactive dendrogram for visualizing the hierarchical relationships
between sensors.

It returns:

- Cluster-level statistical summaries.
- Detailed sensor-wise clustering assignments.
- A dendrogram visualization depicting the hierarchical structure.
